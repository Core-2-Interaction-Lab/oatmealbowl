      When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: <br>
      “That’s a lot of semicolons!” he is absolutely right; <br>
      the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble <br>
      the novel of a savant, but the next time you use a semicolon <br>
      (which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry)<br>
      you should stop and be thankful that there exists this little thing, <br>
      invented by a human being—an Italian as a matter of fact—that allows <br>
      us to go on and keep on connecting speech that for all apparent purposes is unrelated. <br>
      <br>
      You might say a poem is a semicolon, a living semicolon, <br>
      what connects the first line to the last, the act of <br>
      keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart. <br>
      Between the first and last lines there exists—a poem—and if <br>
      it were not for the poem that intervenes, the first and last <br>
      lines of a poem would not speak to each other. <br>
      <br>
      Would not speak to each other. Because the lines of a poem <br>
      are speaking to each other, not you to them or they to you.<br>
