      Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that no poem is ever ended, that <br>
      every poem is merely abandoned. This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, <br>
      for where quotations begin is in a cloud. <br>
      <br>
      Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, and to my mind <br>
      so accurately, that i have never forgotten it: the opening line of a poem, he said, <br>
      is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen <br>
      before, and the poet’s task is to create the tree from which such a fruit would fall.<br>
      <br>
      The painter Cy Twombly quotes John Crowe Ransom, on a scrap of paper: “The image <br>
      cannot be disposed of a primordial freshness which ideas can never claim.”<br>
      <br>
      Easy and appropriate thing for a painter to say. Cy Twombly uses text in some of his <br>
      drawings and paintings, usually poetry, usually Dante. Many men and women have <br>
      written long essays and lectures on the ideas they see expressed in Twombly’s work. <br>
      <br>
      Bachelard’s sentence simply says this: origins (beginnings) have consequences (endings).<br>
      <br>
      The poem is the consequence of its origins. Give me the fruit and I will take from <br>
      it a seed and plant it and watch the tree grow from which it fell. <br>
      <br>
      Barbara Henstein Smith, in her book Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End, says <br>
      this: “Perhaps all we can say, and even this may be too much, is that varying <br>
      degrees or states of tension seem to be involved in all our experiences, and that <br>
      the most gratifying ones are those in which whatever tensions are created are also <br>
      released. Or, to use another familiar set of terms, an experience is gratifying to <br>
      the extent that those expectations that are aroused are also fulfilled.”<br>
      <br>
      But there is no book I know of on the subject of how poems begin. How can the origin <br>
      be traced when there is no form or shape that precedes it to trace? It is exactly like 
      tracing the moment of the big bang—we can go back to a nanosecond before the beginning, 
      before the universe burst into being, but we can’t go back to the precise beginning because 
      that would precede knowledge, and we can’t “know” anything before “knowing” itself was born.
